# Projects
My name is David Haas. I'm using this repository to keep my coding projects to sharpen my skills and have some fun along the way.
I have a bachelor's degree in Physics from Oregon State University and have recently become quite interested in Linux, Python, and raspberry pi.
Let the nerding begin.
